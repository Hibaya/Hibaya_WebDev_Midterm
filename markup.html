    <h1>The Lack Of Happiness </h1> 
    <body>
        <p>Sometimes people might think that you are a <b>failure</b>
        </br>Because of your <em>personality</em> that they <b>judge</b>
    </br>People might think that you cannot do whatever they can do
    </br>Because you mess up always that will not be corrected
</p>
<p>
</br>People might think that you are crazy 
</br>Because no matter what you say or do it will always <strong>fail</strong>
</br>Many people <strong>discourages</strong> you to do what you like 
</br>Because If you do they will be afraid that you can do it <strong>right</strong>
</p>
<p>
</br>People are saying you are being use 
</br>Because many people sees me only for the money that I get and for giving them 
</br>Many people know what its like to be <strong>alone</strong> 
</br>But people will never know <em>true</em> <strong>loneliness</strong> when they cannot experience what its like to be shut by the world.
