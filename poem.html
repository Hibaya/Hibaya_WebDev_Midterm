    <h1>The Lack Of Happiness </h1> 
    <body>
        <p>Sometimes people might think that you are a failure
        </br>Because of your personality that they judge
    </br>People might think that you cannot do whatever they can do
    </br>Because you mess up always that will not be corrected
</p>
<p>
</br>People might think that you are crazy 
</br>Because no matter what you say or do it will always fail
</br>Many people discourages you to do what you like 
</br>Because If you do they will be afraid that you can do it right
</p>
<p>
</br>People are saying you are being use 
</br>Because many people sees me only for the money that I get and for giving them 
</br>Many people know what its like to be alone 
</br>But people will never know true loneliness when they cannot experience what its like to be shut by the world.
