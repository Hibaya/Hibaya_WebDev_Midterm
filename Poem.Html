        <p>Sometimes people might think that you are a failure
            <br>Because of your personality that they judge</br> 
    <br>People might think that you cannot do whatever they can do</br>
    <br>Because you mess up always that will not be corrected</br>
<br>People might think that you are crazy </br>
